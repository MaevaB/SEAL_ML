    These can be conveniently accessed using ChooserEvaluator::default_parameter_options(),
    which returns the above list of options as an std::map, keyed by the degree of the polynomial modulus.
    
    The user can also relatively easily choose their custom coefficient modulus. It should be a prime number
    of the form 2^A - 2^B + 1, where A > B > degree(poly_modulus). Moreover, B should be as small as possible
    for improved efficiency in modular reduction. For security, we recommend strictly adhering to the following 
    size bounds: (see Lepoint-Naehrig (2014) [https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/062])
    /------------------------------------------------------------------\
    | poly_modulus | coeff_modulus bound | default coeff_modulus       |
    | -------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
    | 1x^1024 + 1  | 48 bits             | 2^48 - 2^20 + 1 (47 bits)   |
    | 1x^2048 + 1  | 96 bits             | 2^94 - 2^20 + 1 (93 bits)   |

    The size of coeff_modulus affects the upper bound on the "inherent noise" that a ciphertext can contain
    before becoming corrupted. More precisely, every ciphertext starts with a certain amount of noise in it,
    which grows in all homomorphic operations - in particular in multiplication. Once a ciphertext contains
    too much noise, it becomes impossible to decrypt. The upper bound on the noise is roughly given by 
    coeff_modulus/plain_modulus (see below), so increasing coeff_modulus will allow the user to perform more
    homomorphic operations on the ciphertexts without corrupting them. We would like to stress, however, that
    the bounds given above for coeff_modulus should absolutely not be exceeded.

    Now we set the plaintext modulus. This can be any positive integer, even though here we take it to be a 
    power of two. A larger plaintext modulus causes the noise to grow faster in homomorphic multiplication, 
    and also lowers the maximum amount of noise in ciphertexts that the system can tolerate (see above).
    On the other hand, a larger plaintext modulus typically allows for better homomorphic integer arithmetic,
    although this depends strongly on which encoder is used to encode integers into plaintext polynomials.

    /*
    Plaintext elements in the FV scheme are polynomials (represented by the BigPoly class) with coefficients 
    integers modulo plain_modulus. To encrypt integers instead, one must use an "encoding scheme", i.e. 
    a specific way of representing integers as such polynomials. SEAL comes with a few basic encoders:

    BinaryEncoder:
    Encodes positive integers as plaintext polynomials where the coefficients are either 0 or 1 according
    to the binary representation of the integer to be encoded. Decoding amounts to evaluating the polynomial
    at x=2. For example, the integer 26 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 is encoded as the polynomial 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1.
    Negative integers are encoded similarly but with each coefficient coefficient of the polynomial replaced 
    with its negative modulo plain_modulus.

    BalancedEncoder:
    Given an odd integer base b, encodes integers as plaintext polynomials where the coefficients are according
    to the "balanced" base-b representation of the integer to be encoded, i.e. where each coefficient is in the
    range -(b-1)/2,...,(b-1)/2. Decoding amounts to evaluating the polynomial at x=b. For example, when b=3 the 
    integer 25 = 3^3 - 3^1 + 3^0 is encoded as the polynomial 1x^3 - 1x^1 + 1.
    
    BinaryFractionalEncoder:
    Encodes rational numbers as follows. First represent the number in binary, possibly truncating an infinite
    fractional part to some fixed precision, e.g. 26.75 = 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^1 + 2^(-1) + 2^(-2). For the sake of
    the example, suppose poly_modulus is 1x^1024 + 1. Next represent the integer part of the number in the same
    was as in BinaryEncoder. Finally, represent the fractional part in the leading coefficients of the polynomial, 
    but when doing so invert the signs of the coefficients. So in this example we would represent 26.75 as the 
    polynomial -1x^1023 - 1x^1022 + 1x^4 + 1x^3 + 1x^1. The negative coefficients of the polynomial will again be 
    represented as their negatives modulo plain_modulus.

    BalancedFractionalEncoder:
    Same as BinaryFractionalEncoder, except instead of using base 2 uses any odd base b and balanced 
    representatives for the coefficients, i.e. integers in the range -(b-1)/2,...,(b-1)/2.

    PolyCRTBuilder:
    If poly_modulus is 1x^N + 1, PolyCRTBuilder allows "batching" of N plaintext integers modulo plain_modulus 
    into one plaintext polynomial, where homomorphic operations can be carried out very efficiently in a SIMD 
    manner by operating on such a "composed" plaintext or ciphertext polynomials. For full details on this very
    powerful technique we recommend https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/565.pdf and https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133.

    A crucial fact to understand is that when homomorphic operations are performed on ciphertexts, they will
    carry over to the underlying plaintexts, and as a result of additions and multiplications the coefficients
    in the plaintext polynomials will increase from what they originally were in freshly encoded polynomials.
    This becomes a problem when the coefficients reach the size of plain_modulus, in which case they will get
    automatically reduced modulo plain_modulus, and might render the underlying plaintext polynomial impossible
    to be correctly decoded back into an integer or rational number. Therefore, it is typically crucial to
    have a good sense of how large the coefficients will grow in the underlying plaintext polynomials when
    homomorphic computations are carried out on the ciphertexts, and make sure that plain_modulus is chosen to
    be at least as large as this number.

    For PolyCRTBuilder we need to use a plain modulus congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus), and
    preferably a prime number. We could for example use the following parameters:

    parms.poly_modulus() = "1x^2048 + 1";
    parms.coeff_modulus() = ChooserEvaluator::default_parameter_options().at(2048);
    parms.plain_modulus() = 12289;

    However, the primes suggested by ChooserEvaluator::default_parameter_options() are highly non-optimal 
    in this case. The reason is that the noise growth in many homomorphic operations depends on the remainder
    coeff_modulus % plain_modulus, which is typically close to plain_modulus unless the parameters are carefully 
    chosen. The primes in ChooserEvaluator::default_parameter_options() are chosen so that this remainder is 1 
    when plain_modulus is a (not too large) power of 2, so in the earlier examples this was not an issue. 
    However, here we are forced to take plain_modulus to be odd, and as a result the default parameters are no
    longer optimal at all in this sense.

    Thus, for improved performance when using PolyCRTBuilder, we recommend the user to use their own
    custom coeff_modulus. It should be a prime of the form 2^A - D, where D is as small as possible.
    The plain_modulus should be simultaneously chosen to be a prime congruent to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus),
    so that in addition coeff_modulus % plain_modulus is 1. Finally, coeff_modulus should be bounded by the 
    same strict upper bounds that were mentioned in example_basics():
    /------------------------------------\
    | poly_modulus | coeff_modulus bound |
    | -------------|---------------------|
    | 1x^1024 + 1  | 48 bits             |
    | 1x^2048 + 1  | 96 bits             |
    | 1x^4096 + 1  | 192 bits            |
    | 1x^8192 + 1  | 384 bits            |
    | 1x^16384 + 1 | 768 bits            |
    \------------------------------------/

    One issue with using such custom primes, however, is that they are never NTT primes, i.e. not congruent 
    to 1 modulo 2*degree(poly_modulus), and hence might not allow for certain optimizations to be used in 
    polynomial arithmetic. Another issue is that the search-to-decision reduction of RLWE does not apply to 
    non-NTT primes, but this is not known to result in any concrete reduction in the security level.

    In this example we use the prime 2^95 - 613077 as our coefficient modulus. The user should try switching 
    between this and ChooserEvaluator::default_parameter_options().at(2048) to observe the difference in the 
    noise level at the end of the computation. This difference becomes significantly greater when using larger
    values for plain_modulus.

    /*
    A valid ciphertext consists of at least two polynomials. To read the current size of a ciphertext the
    user can use BigPolyArray::size(). A fresh ciphertext always has size 2, and performing homomorphic multiplication
    results in the output ciphertext growing in size. More precisely, if the input ciphertexts have size M and N,
    then the output ciphertext after homomorphic multiplication will have size M+N-1.

    The multiplication operation on input ciphertexts of size M and N will require M*N polynomial multiplications to be 
    performed. Therefore, the multiplication of large ciphertexts could be very computationally costly and in some situations 
    the user might prefer to reduce the size of the ciphertexts by performing a so-called relinearization operation.

    The function Evaluator::relinearize(...) can reduce the size of an input ciphertext of size M to any size in 
    2, 3, ..., M. Relinearizing one or both of two ciphertexts before performing multiplication on them may significantly
    reduce the computational cost of the multiplication. However, note that the relinearization process also requires 
    several polynomial multiplications to be performed. In particular relinearizing a ciphertext of size K to size L 
    will itself require 2*(K-L)*[floor(log_2(coeff_modulus)/dbc)+1] polynomial multiplications, where dbc is the 
    decomposition_bit_count (see below). It is also important to understand that relinearization grows the inherent noise 
    in a ciphertext by an additive factor proportional to 2^dbc, which can in some cases be very large. When using 
    relinearization it is necessary that the decomposition_bit_count is specified in the encryption parameters, 
    and that enough evaluation keys are given to the constructor of Evaluator. 

    The decomposition_bit_count affects both performance and noise growth in relinearization, as was explained above.
    Simply put, the larger dbc is, the faster relinearization is, and the larger the additive noise growth factor is
    (see above). However, if some multiplications have already been performed on a ciphertext so that the noise has
    grown to some reasonable level, relinearization might have no practical effect anymore on noise due to the additive 
    factor being possibly (much) smaller than what the current noise is. This is why it makes almost never sense to 
    relinearize after the first multiplication since the noise will still be so small that any reasonably large dbc
    would increase the noise by a significant amount. In many cases it might not be beneficial to relinearize at all,
    especially if the computation to be performed amounts to evaluating some fairly low degree polynomial. If the 
    degree is higher, then in some cases it might be beneficial to relinearize at some stage in the computation.
    See below for how to choose a good value for the decomposition_bit_count.

    If the intention of the evaluating party is to hide the structure of the computation that has been performed on 
    the ciphertexts, it might be necessary to relinearize to hide the number of multiplications that the ciphertexts
    have gone through. In addition, after relinearizing (to size 2) it might be a good idea to re-randomize the 
    ciphertext by adding to it a fresh encryption of 0.
   
    In this example we will demonstrate using Evaluator::relinearize(...) and illustrate how it reduces the ciphertext 
    sizes. We will also observe the effects it has on noise.

    The choice of decomposition_bit_count (dbc) can affect the performance of relinearization noticeably. A somewhat 
    optimal choice is to choose it between 1/5 and 1/2 of the significant bit count of the coefficient modulus (see 
    table below). It turns out that if dbc cannot (due to noise growth) be more than one fifth of the significant 
    bit count of the coefficient modulus, then it is in fact better to just move up to a larger poly_modulus and 
    coeff_modulus, and set dbc to be as large as possible.
